# Summer Remote Internship 2024
This repository contains the work I completed during my Summer Remote Internship at CognoRise InfoTech in 2024. The internship involved three key projects focused on applying machine learning techniques to solve real-world problems. Below is an overview of each project.

Project 1: Breast Cancer Classification
Overview:
This project focuses on classifying breast cancer as either benign or malignant using various machine learning algorithms. The dataset used is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset.
Algorithms Implemented:
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest Classifier, Linear Regression, Decision Tree Classifier and Logistic Regression.


Project 2: House Price Prediction
Overview:
This project aimed to predict house prices based on various features such as the area, number of bedrooms, and location. The dataset used was sourced from Kaggle.
Algorithms Implemented:
Linear Regression,random forest regression ,decision tree regression and gradient boosting regressor.


Project 3: Diabetes Prediction
Overview:
This project was focused on predicting the onset of diabetes in patients based on diagnostic measurements.
Algorithms Implemented:
Random Forest Classifier, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), adaboosting classifier,linear Regression and Decision Tree Classifier.


Conclusion
During this internship, I gained valuable experience in applying machine learning techniques to real-world datasets. Each project presented unique challenges and helped me enhance my skills in data preprocessing, model selection, and evaluation.
